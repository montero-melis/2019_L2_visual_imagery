Data exclusion criteria
=======================

Catch trials
---------------

Correct catch trial is either
1. word picture mismatch button
2. typicality rating = 1
--> Threshold: exclude participants <80% on any condition (L1/L2)


Words they didn't know (specific button)
------------------------------------------

Exclude participants who indicated the did not know the word in >20% of trials
in any condition.


Translation task
-----------------

Data for this task is coded with three values:
1) Correct and intended translation (corresponds to the picture)
2) Correct but unintended translation (does not correspond to the picture)
3) Incorrect translation

1 and 2 are considered correct for purposes of data exclusion-

--> We exclude participants who incorrectly translate >20% of trials


Analyses
========

*NB:*
In all analyses, remove incorrectly translated trials


Main analyses
-------------

### Item quality:

- Compute mean typicality + SD
- Translation consistency (percentage responses that were correct and intended
  translations [1 above])


### Standardized ratings?

For choosing the most typical items, we might want to compute standardized
ratings to correct for different ways of using the scale per participant.


Exploratory
-----------

### Mean typicality ratings in L1 vs L2, e.g. as L1-L2 rating difference per item

Exploratory prediction:
Ratings in L2 overall lower (or compressed towards the mean)
Possible explanation:
The noise in semantic processing in L2 makes you unsure and pushes ratings 
towards the middle of the scale


### Participant consistency:

Compute correlation L1-L2 ratings
Is this correlation related to proficiency (use translation score as proxy)?


Final checks
============

- Exclude cognates
- What about compounds?
- Frequency of items? (check with JvP)
