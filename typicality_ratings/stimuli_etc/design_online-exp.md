### Typicality ratings

Trial structure:

On the same screen, show a picture (png file) and display the question: 
“How typical is this [ObjectName]?”
At the bottom of the screen, a 7-point rating scale is shown with the labels: very atypical (far left) and very typical (far right)
Add also two boxes that can be ticked:
-	I don’t know the word
-	I don’t recognize the object
Each picture remains on the screen until a response is made.

Output:
-	Typicality rating OR (at least) one of the boxes checked
-	RT (if easy) for possible sanity checks
